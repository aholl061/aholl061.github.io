											<h2>Get to know me...</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Hi there! My name is Alexus, I am 28 years old from Baltimore, MD. I moved to Norfolk, VA in 2014 when I joined the U.S. Navy and have since decided to call it home. Once my tenure in the Navy ended, I started nursing school and offically became a bachelor's-prepared RN in July of 2021. Now, I'm on to my next venture-pursuing a master's in Data Science & Analytics with a concentration in Engineering and Big Data Analysis (whew, breathe!)<p>
										</p>You may be thinking.."how does any of this relate?" Well, my first answer is that I like to consider myself a woman of many interests--I can't be put inside of a box. My second answer is that it all aligns with a deeper passion for serving others. Everything I do not only gives me a sense of pride and identity, but it also benefits others in meaningful ways, something that has been evident throughout my naval service and my career as a registered nurse.
											<p></p>I plan to use this degree not just to impact one patient or person at a time, but to implement change on a much larger scale for people and communities who truly need it. I currently work at the health department and believe I am in a unique position to drive meaningful change in public health. I aspire to use the knowledge I gain from this program--combined with my nursing experience--to make a big impact at the local, state, and federal levels. I'm excited to see how my skills come together to shape the future!
